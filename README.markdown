MonoTouch.Forms
================

MonoTouch.Forms allows you to easily define iOS dialogs using json and C#. MonoTouch.Forms also simplifies
the display of data from json REST services, by directly binding values in json to fields in forms.

This library is not intented to replace C#, MonoTouch, or  the Apple SDK. Instead, it decreases
the amount of boilerplate code necessary to display simple forms of data, letting you focusing on actual
business logic.


a LOT more documentation will come.
