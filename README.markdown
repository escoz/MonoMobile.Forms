MonoTouch.Forms
================

MonoTouch.Forms allows you to easily define iOS dialogs using json and C#. MonoTouch.Forms also simplifies
the display of data from json REST services, by directly binding values in json to fields in forms.

This library is not intented to replace C#, MonoTouch, or  the Apple SDK. Instead, it decreases
the amount of boilerplate code necessary to display simple forms of data, letting you focusing on actual
business logic.

If you would like to see an application that uses this library in action, download the app GitHubby from the
AppStore. The entire application is written using this library plus a very small portion of C# code. I 
also develop a few other apps using this library, like [Quicklytics](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quicklytics-google-analytics/id354890919?mt=8)

I hope you enjoy this project.
